Shuts down or restarts pc in a fixed time
Hi! I have created this simple script because I often use my pc to play some music before I sleep however I would want the music to stop itself when it reaches a certain time. By running this script, you can listen music to a fixed time and your pc would shut down by the time you are asleep. You wouldn't need to be there to switch your pc off by yourself!
